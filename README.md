# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** using machine learning techniques and text-based similarity measures. The system is designed to recommend movies based on user preferences and content similarity.

## 🚀 Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their similarity to other movies (e.g., genres, descriptions, etc.).
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Extracts important keywords from movie descriptions to measure content similarity.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Computes similarity scores between movies to suggest relevant recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
- The project uses a movie dataset (`movies.csv`) that contains details such as movie titles, genres, and descriptions.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Movie descriptions are processed using the **TF-IDF** technique to transform text data into numerical vectors.
3. **Cosine Similarity**: Pairwise cosine similarity is computed between all movies.
4. **Recommendations**: Based on a user's input (e.g., movie title), the system recommends similar movies.

## 🖥️ Setup and Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd movie-recommendation-system
